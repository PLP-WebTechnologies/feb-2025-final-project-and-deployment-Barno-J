      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Barno June, a Public Health Officer passionate about improving lives improving beyond the clinical setting.</p>
      <p>I started this blog because often, people are silently battling depression, anxiety, or trauma, and unable to access help because they can't afford it, or because services simply aren't there.</p>
      <p>A few years ago, while working in a rural health facility, I met a teenage boy named David (name changed for privacy). His school performance had plummeted, he was often isolated, and his mother brought him in thinking it was a physical illness. But what he really needed was mental health support, one that was not recognized and did not exist nearby. That encounter made it painfully clear that mental health approach should be treated like a real public health issue and that things needed to change.</p>
      <p>This blog is my way of continuing that mission. I want to help bring awareness, provide useful information, and push for a society where mental wellness is accessible to all, no matter where they live or how much they earn.</p>
